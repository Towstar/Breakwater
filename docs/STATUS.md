# Implementation status

Scope: the user's reduced **minimum base for Person A and Person B**, with the complete
accepted plan preserved in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. The original handoff is unchanged.

## Implemented

- C++20 / MSVC numerical library, canonical scenario, native CLI and 13 acceptance cases.
- Generic supported topology, control catalog, immutable candidate compilation, dense
  reference, sparse rollout, allocation-free affine endpoints, independent validator.
- Versioned C++/JSON contracts and scientific-worker protocol/health boundary.
- Native Visual Studio project generation and root `Breakwater.slnx`.
- Qt Quick 3D editor: primitives, placement, connections, pump attachment,
  property editing, save/load, undo/redo, background forecasts and approval invalidation.

## Verified

- `scripts/build.ps1 -Preset headless`: native compilation and all 13 engine cases passed.
- `scripts/Generate-VisualStudio.ps1 -Headless -Build`: Visual Studio/MSBuild x64 build
  and engine acceptance suite passed using MSVC 19.51.36260.0 / CMake 4.3.1.
- `scripts/build.ps1 -Preset asan`: MSVC AddressSanitizer build and engine suite passed.
- Python 3.12.13: `python -m unittest discover -s science/tests -v`: 2 tests passed.
- `scripts/Generate-VisualStudio.ps1 -Build`: full native Visual Studio/MSBuild x64
  RelWithDebInfo solution passed all three CTest suites: engine (13 cases), desktop
  project/controller (7 cases), and QML startup/render smoke (including asset labels).
- Direct `MSBuild.exe Breakwater.slnx /p:Configuration=RelWithDebInfo /p:Platform=x64`:
  root solution built successfully. Generated projects explicitly use v145 / stdcpp20.
- The Qt 6.12.0 scene was captured to `out/desktop-smoke.png` and visually inspected.
  Desktop controller behavior is tested; full mouse-gesture end-to-end automation is later work.

Tested runtime: Qt SDK revision `6.12.0-0-202609280346`, MSVC 19.51.36260.0,
CMake 4.3.1, Visual Studio 2026. Dependency downloads/build products are ignored in `.tools/` and `out/`.

## Planned, not implemented in this base

- Nemotron HTTPS client, real tool dispatcher/loop, batch search and run comparisons.
- Historical run store, replay, robust optimization, and detailed charts.
- Desktop-to-Python process adapter, transport reference, Torch differentiation,
  PhysicsNeMo model/training/inference, and ML readiness evidence.
- Lean/Mathlib project and checked algorithm proofs.
- Performance benchmarks, custom SIMD/GPU kernels, and sophisticated routing handles.

The UI labels these capabilities as planned. No model execution, completed proof,
validated chemical quality, measured speedup, or production control is claimed.
